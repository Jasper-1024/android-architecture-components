Xposed module hide android apps from other android apps

This started out as personel project because a game I downloaded refused to start because I had some app installed (Sigh, control freaks!)
I saw fatminmin's minminhide Xposed Module, but it was not working for me,  the I started building on it.

I did a complete UI rework, I changed All of the hooks.

This is my first xpose modules so experts your feedback is more than welcome! :)
